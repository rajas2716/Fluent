## Challenges Faced
During the development process I faced the following challenges:

1. Started learning nodesjs , react , and watched many youtube videos, which helped me to reach
   basic functionality of the video call application.

2. I explored many github repositories and they were the main help during my process of building.
   Reading documentation was always not enough since I didn't have enough experience in creating softwares.

3. I learnt how to incorporate special feature functionality in the application after many trials
   error.

4. Overall the I learnt many new skills in this program, after struggling a lot since I was a complete beginner. The engage program was quite fruitful.
